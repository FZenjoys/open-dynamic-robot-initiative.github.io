                <h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
                        We present an open-source leg architecture for
                        dynamic legged robot research. We designed a simple and
                        modular actuator-design concept leveraging standard plastic 3D
                        printing and off-the-shelf parts. Our proposed concept allows
                        for rapid distribution and duplication, with little engineering
                        know-how. The light-weight system design enables inexpensive
                        yet high performance force and effective force-control control,
                        up to 11.3 dimensionless leg stiffness without active damping.
                        Its robustness and powerful actuation allows for stark impacts
                        from drops and dynamic locomotion maneuvers. A single leg is
                        actuated by a low-geared but powerful brushless DC actuator
                        module, allowing up to 3.4 Nm joint torque, and 17 N effective
                        (virtual leg length) force. Assembled from its modular actuator
                        nodes, we present the quadruped robot Solo, its locomotion
                        capabilities and dexterity. With a weight of 2.2 kg, Solo is the
                        most light-weight force-controlled modular quadruped robot, to
                        the best of our knowledge. This feature makes it intrinsically
                        safe and ideal for academic research and education: it requires
                        less peak power to locomote, and it can safely be handled by
                        a single researcher.
